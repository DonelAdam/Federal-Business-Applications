# Purpose
In commercial tenants, there is an “Add to Teams” menu option to easily add a Power App to Microsoft Teams.  

[SCREEN SHOT]

This “easy button” is not available in the US government clouds today (as of June 2023). This document outlines the steps to follow to add canvas app as an app in Teams that can be used by users in your tenant.

# Requirements
You will need necessary permissions to upload an app to your tenant.  For more on the required permissions see [LINK]

This will only work for GCC tenants. As of today (June 2023), side loading apps in Teams is not supported in GCC-High, DoD or higher. 

This document assumes you already have a canvas app ready to be published to Microsoft Teams. You will need the App URL located on the app’s details page.
